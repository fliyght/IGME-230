High Concept
The player is a bird, exploring with a friend. There's stuff to collect and dangers to avoid.
Genre
Casual endless runner
Hopefully universal- desktop is what I know how to code.
Story
You are a bird learning how to fly and you have a friend that follows you.
Esthetics
Cartoonish, pixel art maybe.
Soothing sound mostly. Flapping of the bird wings, ambient sounds and soft background music.
Gameplay
Avoidance and collection. It will be side scrolling, collect items to get points and avoid cats to avoid losing points. The player will control the bird with wasd, or their finger if mobile. They will fly into clouds to find items that increase thier score. Cats will jump from the fence in the back and the player must avoid them or lose points.
